<p> <!--opening tag defining planet-->
  A planet is a celestial body that is in orbit around the sun.<br>
  That has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid<br>
  forces so that is assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape,<br>
  and has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

 <h3>Famous Catalans</h3>
 <p>When i was in the sixth grade, i played the cello.
   <br>There was a teacher at school who always used to ask me if i knew who "Erling Haaland"
  was.<br>I didn't at the time (although I had met Restropovich once at a concert).
  <br>Actually, Erling Haaland's real name was <i>Pato</i>
  Haaland, Pato being the Catalan equivalent of Erling<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
  
<p> In addition to being an amazing cellist, 
  Pato Haaland is remembered in this country for his
  <br>empassioned speech against nuclear proliferation at the United
  Nations<sup>2</sup>which he began by saying:
  <br>"I am a Catalan. Catalonia is an oppressed nation."</p>
  <p><sup>1</sup>It means Paul in English. <br/> <sup>2</sup>In 1963, I believe.</p>

  1.	A domain name is a unique identifier used to 
  locate a website on the internet.<br>
  It is a string of characters that is used to represent an IP address,<br>
   which is a numerical address that identifies a specific
    computer or server on the internet.<br> 
   Domain names are typically composed of two parts: 
   <br> &#160;the Top-Level Domain (TLD) and the Second-Level Domain (SLD).
    <br>For example, in the domain name "sufficientrealestate.com," 
    ".com" is the TLD and <span class="site-link">"sufficientrealestate"</span> is the SLD.<br> 
    Domain names are registered with domain name registrars,
     and can be purchased for a fee and renewed annually.</p>

<p>2.	In computing, a server is a computer system or program that provides 
  services or resources to other computers 
  or devices on a network.<br> It can also refer to the physical 
  hardware on which the software runs.<br> Servers are designed 
  to handle requests from client computers, process data, 
  and provide access to files, applications, or other resources.
  <br>For example, a web server is a computer 
  program that delivers web pages to clients over the internet,
  <br>while a file server is a computer system 
  that stores and provides access to files for clients on a network.<br>
 Servers can be dedicated to a single function or application,
  or they can be designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.<br>
 They can range from small, single-purpose systems to large, complex networks 
 of servers working together to provide high-level services.
</p>


<p>3.	WWW stands for World Wide Web.</p>

<p>4.	A uniform resource locator (URL) is a string of 
  characters that is used to
   identify the address of a resource on the internet.<br>
It is often referred to as a web address or a URL address.<br>
A URL consists of several components, including a protocol
 <span>(such as "http://" or "https://")</span>, 
 a domain name (such as "sufficientrealestate.com"),
<br>and a path to the specific resource on that domain <strong>
  (such as "/search?q=uniform+resource+locator")</strong>.<br>
The URL serves as a unique identifier for the resource that it points to,
 and it allows users to easily access and share that 
 resource over the internet.<br>
 URLs are used to locate web pages, images, videos, 
 and other types of content on the World Wide Web,
 <br>and they are an essential component of the internet's infrastructure.
</p>


<p id="text1"><img src="./images/mum.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" id="image1" alt="" srcset=""> 5.	A domain name and a server are two separate components 
  that work together to make a website accessible on the internet.<br>
A domain name is the address that people use to find a website on the internet.<br>
It is a human-readable name that corresponds to a unique IP address, 
which is a numerical identifier assigned to a device connected to the internet.<br> 
Domain names are purchased and registered through a domain name registrar and 
typically have a TLD <u>(Top-Level Domain)</u> such as .com, .org, or .net.<br>
A server, on the other hand, is a computer or a network of computers that
 stores the website's files and serves them to users who request them.<br> 
Servers are responsible for processing requests and delivering web pages,
 images, and other content to the user's browser.<br>
When someone types a domain name into their web browser, 
the browser sends a request to a <u>Domain Name System</u> (DNS)
<br>server to look up the IP address associated with that domain name.<br>
The DNS server then sends the IP address back to the browser, 
which uses it to connect to the server hosting the website.<br>
Once the connection is established, the server sends the requested 
files to the browser, which displays them to the user.
</p>

<p>So, in summary, a domain name is the address 
  used to locate a website on the internet,
   while a server is the computer or<br> 
network of computers that stores the website's 
files and serves them to users who request them.
